## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the background-blend-mode property and also how to better format/position html elements in preparation for a mobile device @media query.

### Continued development

I definitely need more practice with HTML and CSS and general design so will aim to keep working on this alongside Javascript itself.
